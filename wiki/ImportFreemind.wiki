= Import Freemind to XMind =

If you're a freemind user, it's really a good news. XMind is a new 
open source project to do brainstorming and mind mapping. Now you can 
import your freemind maps to XMind, in order to:

 * add attachment files into mindmaps.
 * add my pictures and markers into mindmaps.
 * add fishbone diagrams into mindmaps.
 * add spreadsheets into mindmaps, and treat them as topics.
 * add a legend to show user defined descriptions to each marker.
 * add rich text notes
 * drilldown into a topic, and focus on it.
 * import mindmaps from Mindmanager.
 * share my mindmaps with the world, via [http://share.xmind.net/ Share.xmind.net]. (like YouTube)
